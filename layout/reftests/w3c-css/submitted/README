W3C CSS Test Suite Submission Directory
---------------------------------------

Put tests here that are to be submitted to the official W3C CSS test
suites at http://test.csswg.org/. This directory will be sync'ed
automatically with the contributors/mozilla/ directory in the CSSWG
repository. The master copy is Mozilla's; make edits here, not there.

Tests submitted here must conform to the CSSWG test format:
  http://wiki.csswg.org/test/format
The extra metadata is there to connect tests to their respective specs
and to help reviewers and people trying to debug their implementations
understand and analyze the tests. (These are not write-only regression
tests.)

TEST FILENAMES MUST BE GLOBALLY UNIQUE across the entire CSSWG test repo,
so don't rely on directory names as context.

The W3C format uses <link> tags for connecting reftests to their
references and generates reftest.list from a build process. Until we
set up a build process here, you need to link up the reftest both ways.

Because W3C sometimes needs to allow multiple correct renderings for
a particular case, a test linked to a reference must match ANY of them,
not all of them. To require a test to match all references, chain the
references to each other. If (a discrete number of) multiple renderings
are conformant, make a reftest comparison for each of them, and mark
all but the one we support as 'fails' in the reftest.list.

You can copy the test-template-001.xht and references/test-template-001.xht
files in this directory as a starting point

Submitted tests are tracked in Shepherd: http://test.csswg.org/shepherd/

Some things cannot be reftested; if another format is necessary to test
a particular feature, contact public-css-testsuite@w3.org and/or ask
the layout peers for help.
