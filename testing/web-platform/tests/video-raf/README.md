## Status of these tests

Theses tests are still basic. The specification is still WIP, and rendering tests will be added to ensure consistenty of behavior/timing relative to other [AnimationFrameProviders](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/imagebitmap-and-animations.html#animation-frames) (e.g. window.rAF).
