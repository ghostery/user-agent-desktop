/**
 * Start monitoring all incoming update events about network requests and wait until
 * a complete info about all requests is received. (We wait for the timings info
 * explicitly, because that's always the last piece of information that is received.)
 *
 * This method is designed to wait for network requests that are issued during a page
 * load, when retrieving page resources (scripts, styles, images). It has certain
 * assumptions that can make it unsuitable for other types of network communication:
 * - it waits for at least one network request to start and finish before returning
 * - it waits only for request that were issued after it was called. Requests that are
 *   already in mid-flight will be ignored.
 * - the request start and end times are overlapping. If a new request starts a moment
 *   after the previous one was finished, the wait will be ended in the "interim"
 *   period.
 * @returns a promise that resolves when the wait is done.
