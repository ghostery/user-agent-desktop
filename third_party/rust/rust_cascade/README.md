# rust-cascade
A filter cascade implementation in rust. This uses the 32 bit version of the MurmurHash3 algorithm and is specifically implemented for compatibility with a specific
python filter cascade implementation (https://github.com/mozilla/crlite/blob/master/create_filter_cascade/FilterCascade.py).

See tests in src/lib.rs to get an idea of usage.
