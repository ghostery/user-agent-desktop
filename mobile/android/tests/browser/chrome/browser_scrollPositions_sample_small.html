  <!-- Make the page short enough that it doesn't have a layout scroll range.
       In the absence of an explicit minimum-scale, the minimum scale defaults
       to 0.25, which means the layout viewport will be expanded to up to 4x
       the screen size. So, this assumes the screen size is at least
       250x250. -->
