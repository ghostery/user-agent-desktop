This is a synthetic LISTing based on comments in mirror.pl and a 
screenshot I saw somewhere. Either way, its 'synthetic' because I
couldn't find an FTP server that LISTed like this. Note that (as 
with other VM/CMS LISTings) filesize cannot be determined from 
the listing and (AFAIK) files/dirs not on the 'A' minidisk (see 
'Fm' field) are not RETRievable/CHDIR'able without magic.
