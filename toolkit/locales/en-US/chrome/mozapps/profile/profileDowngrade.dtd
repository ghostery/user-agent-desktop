 This UI can be most easily shown by modifying the version in compatibility.ini
 to a newer version and then starting Firefox.
 For this feature, "installation" is used to mean "this discrete download of
 Firefox" and "version" is used to mean "the specific revision number of a
 given Firefox channel". These terms are not synonymous.
