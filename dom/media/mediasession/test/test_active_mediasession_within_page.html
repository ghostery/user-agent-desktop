/**
 * This test is used to check if the active media session is selected correctly
 * when there are multiple media sessions existing within a same page.
 *
 * `testCases` contains all test cases we're going to execute in this test, and
 * each test would be run in a new window. For each test case, we have several
 * test commands which we would send to window, and the test running in window
 * would do different operations depending on what command we send. After the
 * window finishes running all those commands, it would post a message to tell
 * us its testing result, which can represent if where active media session is
 * created and if the active media session has been changed during testing.
