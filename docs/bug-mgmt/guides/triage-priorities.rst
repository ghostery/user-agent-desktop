Triage Priorities
=================

Our work *must* be focused on Mozillaâ€™s objectives, and as you triage
bugs you should prioritize accordingly.

Defects and tasks which affect:

-  Performance
-  Privacy
-  User Security

should be the highest priorities.

Performance
-----------

-  Use the ``perf`` keyword
-  Add ``[qf:?]`` to the whiteboard if you think the Performance team
   should look at this bug

Privacy
-------

-  Use the ``privacy`` keyword

User Security
-------------

-  Will this bug adversely affect Firefox users if left public?

   -  Add to security group

-  Otherwise move bug to one of:

   -  Core:: Security
   -  Firefox:: Security
   -  Toolkit:: Security
   -  Webkit:: Security
