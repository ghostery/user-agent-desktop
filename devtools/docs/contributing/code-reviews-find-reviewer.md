# Finding suitable reviewers

The code in DevTools is divided into modules (because there's just so much code it's impossible for one person to know *everything* off the top of their head).

Each module has one or more "owners", who know a lot about it. And they're the people you want to ask to review your code ðŸ˜€

You might already know who is the reviewer (perhaps the person that is mentoring the bug, perhaps your team mate), but in case of doubt, you can [consult this list of people and modules](https://firefox-dev.tools/#people-and-modules).
